## 🌐 State Management

This app uses the `provider` package to manage state. UI and logic are kept separate for better clarity.

## 🌍 Localization

Multiple language support is handled with `flutter_localizations` and `intl`. The locale can be changed inside the app.

## 🎨 Theming

Both light and dark themes are available. Users can switch themes and the app remembers the selected theme automatically.
